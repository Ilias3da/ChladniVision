## üåü Features Overview

ChladniVision offers several powerful features to help you classify images effectively.

### üéØ Intelligent Image Classification

ChladniVision uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for high-precision image classification. This method ensures that your images are classified accurately, whether they are common objects or more complex patterns.

### üîß Multiple Feature Extraction Methods

You can choose between two ways to extract features from images:

- **SIFT Features:** Utilizes advanced techniques to identify significant details in images.
- **Pixel Features:** Relies on basic color and light information from images.

### üåê Multi-Language Support

ChladniVision supports English and Chinese interfaces. You can easily switch between languages in the settings.

### üìä Real-Time Predictions

The application allows you to classify single images instantly. You will see the classification result along with the confidence level.

### üé® Visual Display

ChladniVision displays classification results through intuitive visualizations. You can see both the image and its classification outcome clearly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cannot Run the Application:**
   - Ensure Python is installed correctly.
   - Make sure all dependencies are installed, including OpenCV and scikit-learn.

2. **Image Not Classifying:**
   - Check if the image is in a supported format (PNG, JPEG).
   - Ensure that the image has enough detail for classification.

3. **Slow Performance:**
   - Make sure you have enough RAM available for smooth operation.
   - Close other applications that may be using system resources.

### FAQs

- **What is KNN?**
  - KNN is a straightforward and effective classification algorithm that looks at the nearest data points to determine the category of an item.

- **How does the software ensure accuracy?**
  - ChladniVision combines feature extraction with the KNN algorithm to enhance classification precision.
